# JavaScript-Expense-Tracker
An app to track all of your income and expenses

<div>This app is built using vanilla JS and HTML/CSS</div>
<div>Here I have used various array methods such as <strong>map, reduce, filter</strong></div>
<div>I have also added logic to persist the data into <strong>local storage</strong></div>
